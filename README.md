# monerominer



XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight and AstroBWT unified CPU/GPU miner and [RandomX benchmark]. Official binaries are available for Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

## Mining backends
- **CPU** (x64/ARMv8)
- **OpenCL** for AMD GPUs.
- **CUDA** for NVIDIA GPUs via external.

## Download
* **[Binary releases](https://github.com/samisbakedham/monerominer/releases)**

## Usage
The preferred way to configure the miner is the JSON config file as it is more flexible and human friendly. The command line interface does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.
